Differences Between LSTM Layers
=============================

1. Layer 1 (First Layer)
-----------------------
Input: [batch_size, seq_len, input_size]
Example: [32, 100, 10]

What it learns:
- Basic patterns in the raw data
- Simple temporal relationships
- Direct feature interactions

Example with well sensor data:
- Daily patterns (day/night cycles)
- Basic correlations between sensors
- Simple trends in the data

2. Layer 2 (Second Layer)
------------------------
Input: [batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size]
Example: [32, 100, 64]

What it learns:
- Complex patterns from Layer 1's outputs
- Higher-level temporal relationships
- Combined feature interactions

Example with well sensor data:
- Weekly patterns (weekday vs weekend)
- Complex interactions between multiple sensors
- Long-term trends and patterns

3. Key Differences
----------------
Layer 1:
- Processes raw input features
- Learns basic patterns
- Direct connection to input data
- Simpler relationships

Layer 2:
- Processes Layer 1's outputs
- Learns complex patterns
- Indirect connection to input data
- More abstract relationships

4. Data Flow
-----------
Input → Layer 1 → Layer 2 → Output
[10]  → [64]   → [64]   → [1]

Layer 1:
- Takes 10 input features
- Produces 64 hidden states
- Each state captures basic patterns

Layer 2:
- Takes 64 hidden states from Layer 1
- Produces 64 new hidden states
- Each state captures complex patterns

5. Real-world Example
-------------------
Well Sensor Data:
Layer 1 might learn:
- Pressure changes during day/night
- Basic correlations between sensors
- Simple trends

Layer 2 might learn:
- How pressure patterns change on weekends
- Complex interactions between multiple sensors
- Long-term maintenance patterns

6. Why Two Layers?
----------------
- Layer 1: Captures basic patterns
- Layer 2: Combines these patterns into more complex ones
- Together: Can learn both simple and complex relationships
- Better at handling long-term dependencies
